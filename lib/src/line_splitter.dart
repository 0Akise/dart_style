// TODO(rnystrom): This needs to be updated to take into account how it works
// now.
/// Takes a series of [Chunk]s and determines the best way to split them into
/// lines of output that fit within the page width (if possible).
///
/// Trying all possible combinations is exponential in the number of
/// [SplitParam]s and expression nesting levels both of which can be quite large
/// with things like long method chains containing function literals, lots of
/// named parameters, etc. To tame that, this uses dynamic programming. The
/// basic process is:
///
/// Given a suffix of the entire line, we walk over the tokens keeping track
/// of any splits we find until we fill the page width (or run out of line).
/// If we reached the end of the line without crossing the page width, we're
/// fine and the suffix is good as it is.
///
/// If we went over, at least one of those splits must be applied to keep the
/// suffix in bounds. For each of those splits, we split at that point and
/// apply the same algorithm for the remainder of the line. We get the results
/// of all of those, choose the one with the lowest cost, and
/// that's the best solution.
///
/// The fact that this recurses while only removing a small prefix from the
/// line (the chunks before the first split), means this is exponential.
/// Thankfully, though, the best set of splits for a suffix of the line depends
/// only on:
///
///  -   The starting position of the suffix.
///
///  -   The set of expression nesting levels currently being split up to that
///      point.
///
///      For example, consider the following:
///
///          outer(inner(argument1, argument2, argument3));
///
///      If the suffix we are considering is "argument2, ..." then we need to
///      know if we previously split after "outer(", "inner(", or both. The
///      answer determines how much leading indentation "argument2, ..." will
///      have.
///
/// Thus, whenever we calculate an ideal set of splits for some suffix, we
/// memoize it. When later recursive calls descend to that suffix again, we can
/// reuse it.
