/// Takes a single [Line] which may contain multiple [SplitParam]s and
/// [SplitRule]s and determines the best way to split it into multiple physical
/// lines of output that fit within the page width (if possible).
///
/// Finding the best solution to this problem is exponential in the number of
/// splits (which can be large for method calls with a large number of
/// parameters) so a na√Øve brute force solution won't work here. We also can't
/// do something like path-finding since we don't know what the best solution
/// will be ahead of time.
///
/// Instead, this uses dynamic programming to avoid recalculating partial
/// results. The basic algorithm works like so:
///
/// Given a suffix of the entire line, we walk over the tokens keeping track
/// of any splits we find until we fill the page width (or run out of line).
/// If we reached the end of the line without crossing the page width, we're
/// fine and the line is good as it is.
///
/// If we went over, at least one of those splits must be applied to keep the
/// remainder of the line in bounds. For each of those splits, we split at
/// that point and apply the same algorithm for the remainder of the line. We
/// get the results of all of those, choose the one with the lowest cost, and
/// that's the best solution.
///
/// The fact that this recurses while only removing a small prefix from the
/// line (the chunks before the first split), this is exponential. Thankfully,
/// though, the best set of splits for a suffix of the line are independent of
/// anything that comes before it. So, whenever we calculate an ideal set of
/// splits for some suffix, we memoize it. When later recursive calls descend
/// to that suffix again, we can reuse it.
