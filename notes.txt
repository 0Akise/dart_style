Open questions:

- If a collection fits on one line, should it always be made one line?
- When should a parameter/argument list be split to one item per line versus
  packing as many items as fit on each line?

---

Things we should lint on:
- Unnecessary {} in interpolation.
- Ifs with an else where the if or else is not a curly body.
